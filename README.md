# Image Click Coordinates Tracker

## Overview

Image Click Coordinates Tracker is a Python application that allows users to open an image, click on various points within the image, and record the coordinates of each click. Each click is marked with a numbered label on the image, and the coordinates are saved to a text file for reference.

## Features

- **Open and View Images:** Load any image from your file system into the application.
- **Record Click Coordinates:** Click on the image to record the x and y coordinates of each click.
- **Visual Feedback:** Each click is marked with a sequentially numbered label directly on the image.
- **Save Coordinates:** The coordinates of all clicks are saved to a text file, named based on the original image file.

## How to Use

1. **Open an Image:** Click the "Open Image" button to load an image from your file system.
2. **Click on the Image:** Click anywhere on the image to mark the coordinates and save them.
3. **View Coordinates:** The coordinates of each click will be saved in a text file with the same name as the image, appended with `_coordinates`.
